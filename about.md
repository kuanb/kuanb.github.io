#### Quick Pitch

I'm a recent graduate of the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) (previously called Hacker School). It was an amazing experience - for the uninitiated, RC is a 3-month retreat for programmers in New York City. Prior to RC, I was a graduate student at MIT's [Master of City Planning](http://dusp.mit.edu/) [Transportation Systems Planning](http://dusp.mit.edu/transportation/program/overview) program. My interests lie in the implementation of digital solutions in engaging spatial (and, often, transport-related) issues. While I have extensive international experience, from Mexico City to Dhaka, Bangladesh; my interests in tackling urban issues was initially spurred by my time in St. Louis, Missouri. Consequently, I have a particular interest in tackling urban issues specific to the US, as well.

#### Current Work

At present, I am continuing the development and implementation of my ongoing project [Flocktracker](http://flocktracker.org/), with all my awesome teammates at Urban Launchpad and the [Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology](http://smart.mit.edu/). In addition to Flocktracker, I have a number of side projects, both at MIT (such as [CoAXs](https://github.com/mitTransportAnalyst/CoAXs), a bus routing scenario modelling tool I am developing for the Media Lab's [Changing Places Reseach Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/research/groups/changing-places)) and elsewhere (such as [Skyrise](http://skyrise.net/), a cloud-based, real estate asset management tool).

#### Projects List

* [Flocktracker](http://www.flocktracker.org/): The project, which I currently lead remotely, is the result of an ongoing collaborative effort under the research of MIT DUSP's Mobility Futures Collaborative. The current application is based off of initial designs produced with Urban Launchpad in the mapping of Dhaka’s bus system to create the city’s first complete bus map.
* [CoAXs](https://github.com/mitTransportAnalyst/CoAXs): A tool that integrates with bus routing output from tools such as TransitMix (now called ReMix) and plugs into scenario isochrone modelling software developed by the folks at Conveyal (a software consulatancy located in DC). I led the development of the application  within a team at MIT's Media Lab - a staging version is listed in the GH ReadMe if you'd like to view a live demo.
* [Skyrise](http://skyrise.net/): A cloud-based real estate asset management MVP developed in early 2015 in partnership with an early stage start up. The tool utilizes local NYC data sets to aggregate a variety of information regarding properties within the City's Building Information System network.
* [Weather+](http://kuanbutts.com/dataCanvas/): A submission to the Data Canvas worldwide live sensing contest held in early 2015, for which my submission received a "Maker Award." More information can be found on the submission's [splash page](http://kuanbutts.com/dataCanvas/).

* [Urban Planning Blog](http://cargocollective.com/kuanbutts): In the spirit of deep cuts, here is an old collection of writing that I produced on planning. All stream of consciousness, mostly, for this blog.
