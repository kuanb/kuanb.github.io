<sub><sup>Presenting at BetaNYC in October of 2015 in New York on the Code for America Summit report back talk.</sub></sup>

#### Quick Pitch

<sub><sup>Updated December, 2016</sub></sup><br>
I'm a 2016 Code for America Fellow (developer within the Safety/Justice concentration), with 5+ years of experience in data science and software development. Prior to CfA, I've worked in a research developemnt/engineering capacity at Microsoft, the MIT Media Lab, and the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART). More details are available in my [resume](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13557332/Update%20Resume.pdf). My interests lie in the implementation of digital solutions in engaging spatial (often transport-related) issues. Through both my research and work, I've taken on a number of lead technical roles executing digital development and deployment in a wide variety of settings, providing me with extensive international experience; from Mexico City to Dhaka, Bangladesh. That said, my interest in engineering solutions to nuanced urban challenges was initially spurred by my time in St. Louis, Missouri, which fostered a particular interest in domestic research, as well.

#### Current Work

Update (Sep. '15): I have been accepted as a Fellow at Code for America for next year (2016)! From January to November of 2016, I'll be working as a developer helping to improve operations within a partner US city. More details to come.

Update (Aug. '15): As of the end of August, I am a Civic Technology Fellow at Microsoft NY. While a Fellow, I'll be munging through traffic and transit-related datasets and working on some early foundations for the [Microsoft + DataKind Data Science Vision Zero Fellowship](https://blogs.microsoft.com/firehose/2015/08/28/microsoft-partners-with-datakind-vision-zero-to-improve-traffic-safety/).

At present, I am continuing the development and implementation of my ongoing project [Flocktracker](http://flocktracker.org/), with all my awesome teammates at Urban Launchpad and the [Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology](http://smart.mit.edu/). In addition to Flocktracker, I have a number of side projects, both at MIT (such as [CoAXs](https://github.com/mitTransportAnalyst/CoAXs), a bus routing scenario modelling tool I am developing for the Media Lab's [Changing Places Reseach Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/research/groups/changing-places)) and elsewhere (such as [Skyrise](http://skyrise.net/), a cloud-based, real estate asset management tool).

#### Projects List

* [Flocktracker](http://www.flocktracker.org/): The project, which I currently lead remotely, is the result of an ongoing collaborative effort under the research of MIT DUSP's Mobility Futures Collaborative. The current application is based off of initial designs produced with Urban Launchpad in the mapping of Dhaka’s bus system to create the city’s first complete bus map.
* [CoAXs](https://github.com/mitTransportAnalyst/CoAXs): A tool that integrates with bus routing output from tools such as TransitMix (now called ReMix) and plugs into scenario isochrone modelling software developed by the folks at Conveyal (a software consulatancy located in DC). I led the development of the application  within a team at MIT's Media Lab - a staging version is listed in the GH ReadMe if you'd like to view a live demo.
* [Skyrise](http://skyrise.net/): A cloud-based real estate asset management MVP developed in early 2015 in partnership with an early stage start up. The tool utilizes local NYC data sets to aggregate a variety of information regarding properties within the City's Building Information System network.
* [Weather+](http://kuanbutts.com/dataCanvas/): A submission to the Data Canvas worldwide live sensing contest held in early 2015, for which my submission received a "Maker Award." More information can be found on the submission's [splash page](http://kuanbutts.com/dataCanvas/).
* [First Bus Map of Dhaka](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/urbanlaunchpad/first-bus-map-of-dhaka): Bringing the first map of Dhaka’s bus network to life for its millions of daily riders through a successfully funded Kickstarter begun in December of 2012.
