{"name":"Kuan Butts","tagline":"exploring space, digitally","body":"### About\r\nI'm a recent gradaute of MIT's Master of City Planning Transportation Systems Planning program. Currently, I'm at Hacker School in New York. My interests lie in the implementation of digital technologies in engaging spatial (primarily transport-related) issues. I have extensive international experience, from Mexico City to Dhaka, Bangladesh. That said, midwest American holds a special place in my heart, and I hope to eventually use my skills and experiences to addressing issues unique to the recuperation of Rust Belt urban economies, particularly in regards to the retrofitting of existing travel infrastructure. At present, I am continuing the development of my pet project, Flocktracker.\r\n","google":"UA-47292035-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
