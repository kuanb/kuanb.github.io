_Warning: This is an older blog post. I am including it just for posterity, and in the interest of just keeping all my old writing from my "earlier" days._

As mentioned in my last post, I was working on the [Sense Your City](http://datacanvas.org/sense-your-city/) competition hosted by Data Canvas. The results are in and I won the Marker Prize. That means two things:

1. I didn't actually win the really attractive grand prize which included a couple flights all over the world and something around $3,000.

2. That said, I did still nab $500 and a nice little ego boost, so I think I'll take it. It isn't $500 to spend wherever I want, though. It has to be spent, it sounds like, at a website called SeeedStudio. That seems like plenty to play with, though, and I think it would be cool to buy a Raspberry Pi and maybe take my first stab at something in that vein of tinkering.

One of the two grand prize winners, Urban Heartbeat, has a really cool project up over at [their website](http://urban-heartbeat.net/). It involves a sort of audio interpretation of the data each sensor is producing. It's pretty fun; I suggest checking it out.
