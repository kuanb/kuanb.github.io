<h3 href="#blogTitle">I won! Well, sort of...<p>March 28, 2015</p></h3>

<p>As mentioned in my last post, I was working on the <a href="http://datacanvas.org/sense-your-city/">Sense Your City</a> competition hosted by Data Canvas. The results are in and I won the Marker Prize. That means two things:</p>

<p>1. I didn't actually win the really attractive grand prize which included a couple flights all over the world and something around $3,000.</p>
<p>2. That said, I did still nab $500 and a nice little ego boost, so I think I'll take it.</p>

<p>One of the two grand prize winners, Urban Heartbeat, has a really cool project up over at <a href="http://urban-heartbeat.net/">thir website</a>. It involves a sort of audio interpretation of the data each sensor is producing. It's pretty fun; I suggest checking it out.</p>
