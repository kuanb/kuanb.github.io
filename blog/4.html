<h3>Initial Foray into Leaflet and D3<p>November 20, 2014</p></h3>

<p>I'm trying to make a voronoi diagram. Just to get going, I used Citi Bike's station data (they have 332 stations and I just took the live JSON feed to get each of their locations, by parsing through the data with d3's <code>d3.json()</code> capability. Currently, I am failing and getting very far into this project. I've got it working in a static instance, but I can't get it to dynamically update. I want to figure that out by the end of the day, ideally. To keep the map from freaking out, I have disabled all panning and zoom functionality in the below example.</p>

<style>
	#mapN20 {
		width: 500px;
		height: 750px;
	}
	.svgDefault {
		fill-opacity: 0.0;
		stroke: black;
		stroke-width: 1;
	}
</style>

<p id="mapN20" style="width: 500px; height: 750px"></p>

<script src='blog/js/voronoi.js'></script>
<script type="text/javascript">

// instantiate mapN20
var mapN20 = new L.Map("mapN20", { center: [40.725693, -73.983360], zoom: 13, zoomControl:false, dragging: false})
	.addLayer(new L.TileLayer("http://{s}.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/kuanb.ipfm8n84/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"));
mapN20.dragging.disable();
mapN20.touchZoom.disable();
mapN20.doubleClickZoom.disable();
mapN20.scrollWheelZoom.disable();
mapN20.boxZoom.disable();
mapN20.keyboard.disable();

// define source
var url = 'blog/data/bike.json'

// run the visualization
voronoimapN20(mapN20, url);

</script>

<p>At present, the map, as you can see, produces the diagram correctly in a static state. I've understood (learned) how SVG sort of injects itself inside of a layer that Leaflet creates that sits just above the maps layer. Now I need for it to dynamically grab the L.circle objects that are locating the Citi Bike stations and recalculate their new x and y coordinates each time the map is moved. There is this code, that was on a few other Leaflet projects <code>map.on('load moveend', revise());</code> that unforuntately keeps returning a type error to me. Clearly, this is no good and is next on my to-debug list. At the moment though, I am going to need to switch gears and revisit this later in the evening.</p>
