<h3>Further Sloppiness</h3>

<p>I ended up not going back to Node right away. I realized the code issue could be resolved really fast by just dumping Boostrap on this. Now that the CSS is over-encumbered, and the code goes in easily, I also looked to see what other horrors I might bring about. This lead (sp?) me to a modified method of adding blogs. I still run through the list the same way, trying to load blog posts that have yet to be created, but now I also remove the <code>div</code> after creating it if the file returns a 404 error. Glorious. So, now, not only do I try to load files  that do not exist, but then, when they fail to load, I go back and delete the <code>divs</code> I created. So terrible, so glorious.</p>
